# Climate Control system for Lithium-Ion Batteries

What was needed, 
Arduino 101 1x
DHT22 Temperature sensor  1x
Jumper wires (generic) 1x
LED (generic) 2x
Resistor 10k ohm 1x
resistor 330 ohm 2x
DFRobot LCD button shield 1x
breadboard 1x

	Developed a climate control system for Lithium-Ion Batteries
	Control of temperature in values of grades and control for hysteresis using DHT22 and Arduino 101.
	All stages of product concept, testing, verifying and prototyping was done to meet the demands in the requirements.
